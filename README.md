# CreateAccount-JS-Demo

Demo for JavaScript training

Updated my "Create Account" page using JavaScript and validations provided by Kalashree. This demo is used to show what I learned in the first four weeks of my training as a Software Developer. The Create Account page features six different text fields to input personal information (i.e. First/Last Name, Email, Password, and Phone Number). Additionally, I provided a date input so that the user can provide their birthday. Last, I added a submission button that reads "Join Now". 

In this updated version og my Create Account page, users can input their information in the text boxes, and the 'Create Account' form will validate their paratameters. For example, the form will display error messages if the First and Last name text boxes contain numbers, if the email format is incorrect (i.e. name@gmail.com), if the password doesn't contain the correct elements (i.e. upper case and lower case letters, and at least one number), if the confirmation password doesn't match the input password, and if the phone number contains letters or if it is not the correct length.

Additionall, I attempted to style the Create Account page as a DCKAP developer would by adding a color palette that is reminiscent of the the DCKAP colors. Additionally, I attempted to create a modern-looking page by making it responsive to the best of my abilities.
